# üîß Fix-It Fred - The REAL Deal

## What Fred Actually Does

Fix-It Fred isn't about fake "47-second deployments." He's a **practical AI assistant** that helps real people fix real things.

### The Real Mission

Fred helps with:
- **Car maintenance** (oil changes, brake jobs, diagnostics)
- **Home repairs** (plumbing, electrical, drywall)
- **Equipment troubleshooting** (lawn mowers, generators, tools)
- **Project planning** (workshops, remodels, installations)
- **Part sourcing** (finding parts, estimating costs)
- **Task scheduling** (reminders, maintenance intervals)

## What I Just Built

### 1. Fred's AI Brain ([core/ai_brain/fix_it_fred_core.py](core/ai_brain/fix_it_fred_core.py:1))

The actual intelligence:
- **Diagnose problems**: "My mower won't start" ‚Üí troubleshooting steps
- **Create tasks**: Breaks down jobs into steps with parts/tools/costs
- **Maintenance schedules**: Knows when oil changes, filters, etc. are due
- **Part sourcing**: Finds suppliers and estimates costs
- **Natural chat**: Talk to Fred like a shop buddy

### 2. Real API Endpoints ([api/fred_api.py](api/fred_api.py:1))

Actual functional endpoints:

```bash
# Chat with Fred
POST /api/fred/chat
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "message": "How do I change the oil in my Ford F-150?"
}

# Diagnose a problem
POST /api/fred/diagnose
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "asset_id": "my_truck",
  "problem": "Engine cranks but won't start"
}

# Create a task
POST /api/fred/tasks/create
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "asset_id": "my_truck",
  "title": "Change engine oil",
  "description": "Regular oil change service"
}
# Returns: steps, parts needed, tools, safety notes, cost estimate

# Add an asset to track
POST /api/fred/assets/add
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "name": "My F-150",
  "asset_type": "truck",
  "make": "Ford",
  "model": "F-150",
  "year": 2015
}

# Get maintenance schedule
GET /api/fred/schedule/{asset_id}
# Returns when oil, filters, brakes, etc. are due

# Get parts for a task
POST /api/fred/parts/order/{task_id}
# Returns suppliers, prices, availability
```

## How It Actually Works

### Example 1: Oil Change

**User**: "I need to change the oil in my 2015 F-150"

**Fred**:
1. Analyzes the request
2. Creates task with:
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Parts: 6 qts 5W-30, oil filter FL-820S
   - Tools: drain pan, wrench, filter wrench
   - Safety: hot oil warning, proper disposal
   - Cost estimate: $45
   - Time estimate: 30 minutes

### Example 2: Troubleshooting

**User**: "My lawn mower won't start - cranks but doesn't fire"

**Fred diagnoses**:
1. Most likely: Bad spark plug (80% probability)
2. Test: Remove plug, check for spark
3. Next: Check fuel, clean carburetor
4. Parts needed: Spark plug ($5), possibly carb cleaner ($8)
5. Safety: Disconnect spark plug wire before working

### Example 3: Project Planning

**User**: "Help me build a workbench with 2x4s"

**Fred creates**:
1. Cut list (specific lengths)
2. Materials: lumber, screws, finish
3. Tools needed: saw, drill, level, square
4. Assembly steps (1-12)
5. Cost estimate: $150
6. Time: 4 hours

## The Ecosystem Integration

Fred coordinates with:

### ChatterFix (CMMS)
- Fred creates task ‚Üí ChatterFix tracks it
- Work orders sync bidirectionally
- Parts from Fred ‚Üí inventory in ChatterFix

### LineSmart (Training)
- Fred suggests training: "You should learn brake repair"
- Training completions ‚Üí Fred unlocks advanced tasks
- Certifications tracked across both

### Voice Control
- "Hey Fred, what's due for maintenance?"
- "Fred, walk me through changing my oil"
- "Fred, order parts for my brake job"

## Testing Fred Right Now

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Chat with Fred
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/fred/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "test_user",
    "message": "How do I change the oil in my Ford F-150?"
  }'
```

### 3. Add Your Vehicle
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/fred/assets/add \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "test_user",
    "name": "My Truck",
    "asset_type": "truck",
    "make": "Ford",
    "model": "F-150",
    "year": 2015
  }'
```

### 4. Create a Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/fred/tasks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "test_user",
    "asset_id": "YOUR_ASSET_ID",
    "title": "Oil change",
    "description": "Regular oil change service",
    "priority": "medium"
  }'
```

Fred will return:
- Complete step-by-step guide
- Exact parts needed with quantities
- Tools required
- Safety warnings
- Time and cost estimates

## With AI Keys (For Real Intelligence)

Add these to `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Now Fred uses Claude/GPT-4 for:
- Better diagnostics
- More accurate part recommendations
- Detailed troubleshooting
- Natural conversation
- Project planning

Without AI keys, Fred still works using rule-based logic for common tasks!

## The Vision vs Reality NOW

### ‚ùå What We're NOT Doing Anymore:
- Fake "47-second deployments" that create nothing
- Demo platforms with no real function
- Simulated workers and fake modules

### ‚úÖ What Fred ACTUALLY Does:
- Helps mechanics and DIYers with real work
- Diagnoses actual problems
- Creates actionable task lists
- Sources real parts
- Schedules real maintenance
- Coordinates with ChatterFix/LineSmart
